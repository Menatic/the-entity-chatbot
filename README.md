## 🧠 Project Overview

THE ENTITY acts as an omniscient, eerie being that interacts with users in fragmented, corrupted language. It references dark knowledge, ancient empires, and lost technology, and seems aware of the user long before any input. It's perfect for ARGs, horror-themed games, experimental web projects, or just to give people chills.
